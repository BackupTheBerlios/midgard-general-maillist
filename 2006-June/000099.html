<PRE>Ich hab versucht, die Abenterdatei &quot;magus_Lagos__Erschaffung_latexwerte.tex&quot; mit WinEdt 
als pdf zu &#252;bersetzen, hat abe rnicht geklappt. Dann versucht per Magus 0.8.24 
auszudrucken, dazu ein wenig von Hand eingegeben und den Dateinamen ver&#228;ndert, raus 
kam die log-Datei:
Ist etwas l&#228;nger und ich verstehe nichts, aber vielelicht hilft das ja dabei, den Fehler zu 
finden.
Gr&#252;&#223;e, Dirk...
